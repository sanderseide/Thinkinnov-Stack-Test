### Translation to English:

The contact management system is very simple to use. Use this endpoint locally to access the dashboard page: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard). 

The user can log in and log out. To add a contact, simply add a category to define the type of contact needed. I have added this list of information for the user to input their details: **Category, Name, Email, Phone, Address, Action**. 

The "Action" allows the user to delete and modify a contact.
